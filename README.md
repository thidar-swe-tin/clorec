This project uses the dataset on ‘Amazon Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry’ to provide sentiment analysis and recommendations to users. To carry out our investigation, we use logistic regression for the sentiment analysis and, use and compare the performance of three different collaborative filtering techniques (SVD, IMF, TF-IDF) for the recommendations. Each of the above three methods are evaluated on an independent test dataset consisting of the current purchases of around 45,184 users, and compared to a baseline model that recommends the 10 most popular products to each user. We can now determine if the products suggested by our recommender systems result in more purchases on Amazon as compared to the baseline model.
